### Learning Git Commands and GitHub

This guide is designed to help you learn the basics of Git and GitHub, two essential tools for version control and collaboration in software development.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Git installed on your system. You can download Git from the official website.

Next, create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects.

Once you have Git and GitHub set up, you can start using Git to manage version control for your projects and collaborate with others on GitHub.

## Git Commands

Git uses a command-line interface for managing version control. Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:

`git init` - Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory

`git add` . - Add all changes to the staging area

`git commit -m "Commit message"` - Commit changes with a descriptive message

`git status` - Check the status of the repository

`git log` - View the commit history

`git branch` - List all branches in the repository

`git checkout <branch-name>` - Switch to a different branch

`git merge <branch-name>` - Merge changes from a different branch into the current branch

`git push <remote-name> <branch-name>` - Push changes to a remote repository on GitHub

`git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>` - Pull changes from a remote repository on GitHub

## GitHub Features

GitHub provides a number of features to help you collaborate with others on your projects. Here are some basic GitHub features to get you started:

- Repositories - A place to store and manage your code
- Issues - A way to track and manage bugs, feature requests, and other tasks
- Pull Requests - A way to propose and discuss changes to the codebase with others
- Collaborators - A way to add others to your repository and collaborate on the code
- Projects - A way to organize and track tasks and progress in your repository
